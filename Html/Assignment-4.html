    <h1>The History of Computers and the Internet</h1>
    <h2 style="margin-left: 10px;">The Abacus (c. 4000 BCE)</h2>
    <p style=" margin-right: 10%; font-size: 30px;">The abacus, created by the Chinese, is often regarded as the first computing device. It consisted of beads strung on rods and was used to perform simple arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction. Over time, different versions of the abacus spread across Asia, becoming an essential tool for calculations.</p><br>

     <h2 style="margin-left: 10px;">Napier's Bones (1617)</h2>
    <p style=" margin-right: 10%; font-size: 30px;">Invented by John Napier,<strong> Napier's Bones</strong> were a set of ivory rods engraved with numbers, designed to assist with multiplication and division. This invention also introduced the <u>concept of the decimal point</u> a crucial development in simplifying calculations.</p><br>

    <h1> Mechanical Calculators (17th-19th Century)</h1>
    <h2 style="margin-left: 10px;">Pascaline (1642-1644)</h2>
    <p style=" margin-right: 10%; font-size: 30px;">French mathematician <strong>Blaise Pascal</strong> developed the <strong>Pascaline</strong>, the first mechanical calculator capable of performing addition and subtraction. It used gears and wheels to calculate, and its purpose was to help Pascalâ€™s father, a tax collector, with his work.</p><br>

     <h2 style="margin-left: 10px;">Stepped Reckoner (1673)</h2>
    <p style=" margin-right: 10%; font-size: 30px;">German philosopher and mathematician <strong> Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz</strong> improved Pascal's design, developing the Stepped Reckoner. It was capable of performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and it used fluted drums instead of gears.</p>
